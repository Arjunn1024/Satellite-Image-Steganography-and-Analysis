# Question-Answer Bot

This project is a Question-Answer Bot built using various NLP models, including T5 for question generation and spaCy for text processing. The bot processes text from uploaded PDF files, generates questions, extracts answers from the text, and evaluates the questions using ROUGE scores.

## Features
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Extracts text content from uploaded PDF files.
- **Question Generation**: Generates questions based on the extracted text using a pre-trained T5 model.
- **Answer Extraction**: Extracts answers from the text based on the generated questions.
- **ROUGE Score Calculation**: Evaluates the generated questions by calculating ROUGE scores against reference questions.
